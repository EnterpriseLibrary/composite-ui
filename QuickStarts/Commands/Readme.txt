* What Is It Intended to Show?
This QuickStart shows the usage of the Command feature of CAB. In particular,
how to use the Command architecture for UIElements.
It also presents a sample of how to load and create the menu items associated to
the Commands from a configuration file.

* How Do I Use It?
Build and run the CommandQuickStart WinForm application. The application
starts by showing a main form that has menu items.

* What Should I Look At? 
The main points of interest are to look at how the Commands are related to UIElements.
Note how the UIElements are created and how the CommandMap is processed.

application block documentation.
