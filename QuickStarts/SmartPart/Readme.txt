* What Is It Intended to Show?
This QuickStart shows the usage of the SmartParts, Workspaces and WorkItems features of CAB. 
In particular, it shows how to build SmartParts and how to structure them in a 
parent-child WorkItem relationship.

* How Do I Use It?
Build and run the SmartPart WinForm application. A main form with a customer 
list will appear.

* What Should I Look At? 
The main points of interest are the use of the Deck and Tab Workspaces with SmartParts.
Another point of interest is the parent-child relationship between the BrowseCustomersWorkItem and the ViewCustomerWorkItem.

For more information about the SmartParts QuickStart, see the QuickStarts section in the application block documentation.
