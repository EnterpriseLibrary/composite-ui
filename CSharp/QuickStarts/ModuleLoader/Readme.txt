* What Is It Intended to Show?
This QuickStart shows the use of the ModuleLoaderService feature of CAB.

* How Do I Use it?
Build and run the ModuleLoaderQuickstart WinForm application. The application will start 
by displaying a message box followed by a small form. The 
message boxes notify you of the module initialization and service creation.

* What Should I Look At? 
The main point of interest is to look at the ProfileCatalog.xml and how the
FileCatalogEnumerator and ModuleLoader processes that information.
Also, look at how the services are declared in the GPSModule and how the module 
initialization is done.

For more information about the ModuleLoader QuickStart, see the QuickStarts section in 
the application block documentation.
